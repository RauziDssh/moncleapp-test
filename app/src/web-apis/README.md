### About

These are predefined API calls that the monocle can use.

Since the monocle does not have wifi, it needs another device eg. a phone to call web apis.

The web api calls are simplified where they can be called as a simple function call from mpython to JS.

The logger picks up this request on JS side and does the call.

The monocle does not have a lot of storage so that also needs to be considered regarding how much data is sent/stored on the monocle.
