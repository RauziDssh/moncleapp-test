So I'm still unsure how this thing will come together.

There needs to be an editable JS aspect that's known... but it could be "abstracted" in a way where it's literally just a bridge

I have to test the data transfer... the screen can only fit something like 200-250 characters on it.

You have to chunk things down to read them until the font can be scaled down.

I'm trying to avoid a JS-driven monocle state

The PWA has bluetooth lag when the app is not focused, I'm not even sure if bluetooth will keep running when the phone screen is off

I need to test that

- [ ] First priority is to get the whole snippet-combiner/persistence writer working

Then

- [ ] test inactive bluetooth lag/does it still work
- [ ] check storage usage of characters
