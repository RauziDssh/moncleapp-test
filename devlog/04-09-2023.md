I've slowed down, feeling down

The goal is I have the monocle where I can pull it out of the case and it goes through my basic news reading cycles

I go and wash dishes/make food, takes about an hour

One thing I considered was somehow getting subtitles to podcasts to show up as the people talked but that would be hard with this hardware/compatibility

The workout app is not really something I use, it was just the first "real app" I made where it takes input from the monocle touchpads and advances the app state

HN reader I already wrote the JS code to pull data... need to feed it into the monocle

Will get storage to watch it

5:24 PM

took a brief break, show's back on yeeee

I'm going to try and get the block size stuff working

so... this is the output of `os.statvfs("/")` / is root path

`(4096, 4096, 147, 145, 145, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255)`

`f_bsize, f_frsize, f_blocks, f_bfree, f_bavail, f_files, f_ffree, f_favail, f_flag, f_namemax`

4096 bytes block size

145 free blocks

about 594Kb

I'll add the ram thing in

I have to end the work for this today since I have other things to worry about (life)

I want to get this to a usable state

5:56 PM

I need the API bridge setup

6:02 PM

alright let's go, start making progress

- [x] poll on UI to watch ram/storage usage
- [x] welcome scene
- [x] weather scene
  - fake for now till I get some API (needs key)
    I have one already but have to wire it up, deal with remote/local domain
- [x] scene to say "Loading news articles"
- [ ] "Loading hn articles"
  - pull mpython code from JS
- [ ] way to continue/keep going

7:50 PM

I'm stuck, tried to send string into monocle runtime memory by `json.loads` doesn't work

once that happens though, then you just run it through a display/chunker
