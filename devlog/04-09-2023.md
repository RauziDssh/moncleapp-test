I've slowed down, feeling down

The goal is I have the monocle where I can pull it out of the case and it goes through my basic news reading cycles

I go and wash dishes/make food, takes about an hour

One thing I considered was somehow getting subtitles to podcasts to show up as the people talked but that would be hard with this hardware/compatibility

The workout app is not really something I use, it was just the first "real app" I made where it takes input from the monocle touchpads and advances the app state

HN reader I already wrote the JS code to pull data... need to feed it into the monocle

Will get storage to watch it

took a brief break, show's back on yeeee

I'm going to try and get the block size stuff working

so... this is the output of `os.statvfs("/")` / is root path

`(4096, 4096, 147, 145, 145, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255)`

`f_bsize, f_frsize, f_blocks, f_bfree, f_bavail, f_files, f_ffree, f_favail, f_flag, f_namemax`

4096 bytes block size

145 free blocks

about 594Kb

I'll add the ram thing in
