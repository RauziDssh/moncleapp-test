### About

This is a very basic web-editor that can combine scripts stored in local storage and write to monocle flash.

Still mostly conceptual since unsure how it will all work regarding what would make sense logic wise.

Has different sample code

### Disclaimer

This does not have a linter (does not understand code). Also does not feature code highlighting.

This assumes whatever code you're writing will work and if there are errors you'll only see them during the upload process (writing to monocle).
