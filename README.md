### About

This primarily is a way to headlessly feed code into the Brilliant Labs Monocle AR device.

In my case I prefer web-based apps over native due to lack of skill.

I'm building on top of the bluetooth via JS capability (Chrome) provided by this [library](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/web-bluetooth-repl).

After that I can just use this to feed micropython code designed in other places, right now I've got my own editor but not really an editor.
