### About

This is an app launcher written in ReactJS as a PWA

Apps

### Live demo (try on your monocle)

note: the source for the PWA live demo above is in the docs folder (static build)

### Note memory
Everytime you push micropython code into the monocle it uses up ram/storage on the monocle.

Eventually the monocle will reboot itself.

### Note about state

Ideally you design your apps where they are not tied to the phone (except say for data transfer). So that you don't continuously push micropython code into the monocle, that's not a bad thing but you can optimize your apps by planning the design around static python code vs. dynamically generated by JS.

### JS to micropython/monocle

I'm building on top of the bluetooth via JS capability (Chrome) provided by this [library](https://github.com/siliconwitchery/web-bluetooth-repl).
